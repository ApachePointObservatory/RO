History:
2003-03-21 ROwen    splitPath
2003-03-24 ROwen    added walkDirs
2003-04-18 ROwen    added expandFileList; added patWarn arg. to walkDirs.
2003-11-18 ROwen    Modified to use SeqUtil instead of MathUtil.
2004-02-04 ROwen    Renamed to OSUtil and moved into the OS package;
                    added expandPath, realPath and removeDupPaths.
2004-02-05 ROwen    Added exclPatterns to walkDirs.
2004-02-06 ROwen    Combined walkDirs and expandPathList into findFiles
                    and changed recurseDirs to recursionDepth.
2004-05-18 ROwen    Modified splitPath to use var end (it was computed but ignored).
2005-08-02 ROwen    Added getResourceDir
2005-10-07 ROwen    splitPath bug fix: on Windows the first element
                    (disk letter) included a backslash.
2006-08-18 ROwen    Added delDir.
2007-01-17 ROwen    Modified getResourceDir to work with pyinstaller.
2011-08-01 ROwen    findFiles: added arguments dirPatterns and exclDirPatterns; modified to use os.walk.
2011-09-09 ROwen    Misfeature fix: findFiles could return paths that start with "./".
2011-10-11 ROwen    findFiles: document recursionDepth argument.

    - All matching files in paths or in searched directories are included in the output list.
    
    One use is to handle a list of files that has been dragged and dropped on an applet.

    Inputs:
    - paths: one or a sequence of paths; files are checked to see if they match

    - patterns: one or a sequence of inclusion patterns; each file name must match at least one of these;
        if None or [] then ["*"] is used.
        Patterns are matched using fnmatch, which does unix shell-style matching
        (* for any char sequence, ? for one char).
    - exclPatterns: one or a sequence of exclusion patterns; each file name must not match any of these
    - dirPatterns: one or a sequence of inclusion patterns; each directory name must match at least one of these;
        if None or [] then ["*"] is used.
    - exclDirPatterns: one or a sequence of exclusion patterns; each directory name must not match any of these
    - recursionDepth: recursion level; None or an integer n:
        None means infinite recursion
        n means go down n levels from the root path, for example:
        0 means don't even look inside directories in paths
        1 means look inside directories in paths but no deeper
    - returnDirs: include directories in the returned list?
    - patWarn: print to sys.stderr names of files and directories that don't match the pattern

    Returns a list of unique paths.
    
    Notes:
    - Pattern matching is applied to files and directories in the paths argument,
      as well as files and directories in subdirectories.
    - Duplicate paths are removed
    
    Pattern special characters are those for fnmatch:
    *       match any sequence of 0 or more characters

    [seq]   matches any character in seq
